# Welcome to AXS
Astronomy Extensions for Spark, or AXS, is a distributed framework for 
astronomical data processing based on Apache Spark. AXS provides simple 
Python API to enable fast cross-matching, querying and analysis of data
from astronomical catalogs.

# Installing
To install AXS follow these steps (note that Anaconda installer is planned
for the future):
1. Download the latest AXS tarball from the [realeases page](https://github.com/dirac-institute/AXS/releases).
2. Unpack the tarball to a directory of your choosing.
3. Set `SPARK_HOME` environment variable to point to the extraction directory.
4. Add `SPARK_HOME/bin` to your `PATH` variable.

And you're got to go!
